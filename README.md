# Friend-Finder

We need to compare variations between the score that the user inputs in the application to a friend that also has numbers.
1.) We need to create server, packages and routes.
2.) We started by requiring express and creating the ports and enabling the port to function on server.js. I had difficulties installing the express body but this was entralling to learn.
3.) We then created our friends.js and listed all of our friends that we can match with by providing an image and various score.

4.) we created our home page with the help of the in class exercise of the table reservationa and we used the option tag to be able to choose a number.
5.) We then had to create html routes by requiring path and enabling our functions.
6.) Consequently we proceeded to construct our api routes by making a variable of friends and requiring friends in through our specific pat, and proceeding to enable app methods. We had to add a for loop so we could loop through all of our possble matches.

This was the most collaborative process yet of creating an app with servers and using express to a great capacity. 
Thank you.
